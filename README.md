# vkBasalt
vkBasalt is a Vulkan post processing layer to enhance the visual graphics of games.

Currently, the build in effects are:
- Contrast Adaptive Sharpening 
- Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing
- Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing
- Deband/Dithering
- 3D color LookUp Table

It is also possible to use Reshade Fx shaders.

## Disclaimer
This is one of my first projects ever, so expect it to have bugs. Use it at your own risk.

## Install
**There are binaries attached to each release, so manually building from source is not required**

Once you have the binaries, either by downloading and unpacking them or by following the build instructions below, execute:
```
make install
```
**Note: do not run this with `sudo`. vkBasalt gets installed for the current user only.**

## Build Dependencies

### Prerequisites
Before building, you will need:
- glslangValidator - To compile the shader
- GCC >=9
- X11 development files

See below on how to install them.

#### Arch-based distributions
For Arch-based distributions, execute:
```
pacman -Syu glslang vulkan-tools lib32-libx11 libx11
```
#### Fedora
For Fedora, execute:
```
sudo dnf install vulkan-tools glslang libX11-devel glibc-devel.i686 libstdc++-devel.i686 spirv-tools libX11-devel.i686
```
#### Gentoo-based distributions
For Gentoo-based distributions, execute:
```
sudo emerge -v dev-util/glslang dev-util/vulkan-tools dev-util/spirv-tools
```
## Build
To build and install the program, execute:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt.git ~/vkBasalt
cd ~/vkBasalt
make
```
##### TIP: Use the `-jX` (where X=number of cpu threads) option to accelerate the building process.

## Usage
Enable the layer with the environment variable (see below). Since vkBasalt 0.2.0 there is one unified variable for 64-bit and 32-bit games.

### Standard
When using the terminal or an application (.desktop) file, execute:
```ini
ENABLE_VKBASALT=1 yourgame
```

### Lutris
With Lutris, follow these steps below:
1. Right click on a game, and press `configure`.
2. Go to the `System options` tab and scroll down to `Environment variables`.
3. Press on `Add`, and add `ENABLE_VKBASALT` under `Key`, and add `1` under `Value`.

### Steam
With Steam, edit your launch options and add:
```ini
ENABLE_VKBASALT=1 %command% 
```

## Configure

Settings like the CAS sharpening strength can be changed in the config file.
The config file will be searched for in the following locations:
* a file set with the environment variable`VKBASALT_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/vkBasalt.conf`
* `vkBasalt.conf` in the working directory of the game
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vkBasalt/vkBasalt.conf` or `~/.config/vkBasalt/vkBasalt.conf` if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set
* `$XDG_DATA_HOME/vkBasalt/vkBasalt.conf` or `~/.local/share/vkBasalt/vkBasalt.conf` if `XDG_DATA_HOME` is not set
* `/usr/share/vkBasalt/vkBasalt.conf`
* `/usr/local/share/vkBasalt/vkBasalt.conf`

If you want to make changes for one game only, you can create a file named `vkBasalt.conf` in the working directory of the game and change the values there.

#### Ingame Input

The [HOME key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_key) can be used to disable and re enable the applied effects. This is based on X11 so it won't work on pure wayland. It **should** however at least not crash without X11.

#### Reshade Fx shaders

To run reshade fx shaders e.g. shaders from the [reshade repo](https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders), you have to set `reshadeTexturePath` and `reshadeIncludePath` to the matching dirctories from the repo. To then use a specific shader you need to set a custom effect name to the shader path and then add that effect name to `effects` like every other effect.

```ini
effects = colourfulness:denoise

colourfulness = /home/user/reshade-shaders/Shaders/Colourfulness.fx
denoise = /home/user/reshade-shaders/Shaders/Denoise.fx
reshadeTexturePath = /home/user/reshade-shaders/Textures
reshadeIncludePath = /home/user/reshade-shaders/Shaders
```

#### Debug Output

The amount of debug output can be set with the `VKBASALT_LOG_LEVEL` env var, e.g. `VKBASALT_LOG_LEVEL=debug`. Possible values are: `trace, debug, info, warn, error, none`.

By default the logger outputs to stderr, a file as output location can be set with the `VKBASALT_LOG_FILE` env var, e.g. `VKBASALT_LOG_FILE="vkBasalt.log"`.


## FAQ

#### Why is it called vkBasalt?
It's a joke: vulkan post processing &#8594; after vulcan &#8594; basalt
#### Does vkBasalt work with dxvk and vkd3d?
Yes.
#### Will vkBasalt get me banned?
Maybe. To my knowledge this hasn't happened yet but don't blame me if your frog dies.
#### Will there be a openGl version?
No. I don't know anything about openGl and I don't want to either. Also openGl has no layer system like vulkan.
#### Will there be a GUI in the future?
Maybe, but not soon.
#### So is vkBasalt just a reshade port for linux?
Not really, most of the code was written from scratch. vkBasalt directly uses reshade source code for the shader compiler (thanks [@crosire](https://github.com/crosire)), but that's about it.
#### Does every reshade shader work?
No. Shaders that need multiple techniques do not work, there might still be problems with stencil and blending and depth buffer access isn't ready yet.
#### You said that "depth buffer access isn't ready yet", what does this mean?
There is a wip version that you can enable with `depthCapture = on`. It will lead to many problems especially on non nvidia hardware. Also the selected depth buffer isn't always the one you would want.
#### Is there a way to change settings for reshade shaders?
There is some support for it [#46](https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt/pull/46). One easy way so to simply edit the shader file.
